# Versioned Data Strategy

In our project, we chose DVC as the data versioning tool because it allows us to track changes in data, handle remote storage, and efficiently manage large amounts of data. One of the primary reasons we are using DVC is its seamless integration with GitHub, which is our main version control system for code. This integration allows us to track both data and code in parallel, so every time we commit code changes, related data changes are also versioned. This ensures we can maintain consistency across both code and data, which is critical for reproducibility.

In addition, DVC is particularly useful for our team because it works well with cloud storage solutions, like Google Cloud Storage, which we are using as our primary storage for large datasets. By connecting to cloud storage, DVC provides the flexibility to handle large and multiple datasets that are shared across multiple team members, regardless of their physical location. This flexibility significantly enhances our ability to manage, version, and collaborate on large-scale data while ensuring that everyone on the team has access to the right version of the data, at any point in time.
